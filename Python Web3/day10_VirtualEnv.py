'''
Think of a virtual environment as a separate container for each Python project. Each container:

Has its own Python interpreter
Has its own set of installed packages
Is isolated from other virtual environments
Can have different versions of the same package
'''

Using virtual environments is important because:

It prevents package version conflicts between projects
Makes projects more portable and reproducible
Keeps your system Python installation clean
Allows testing with different Python versions
